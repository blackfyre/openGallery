openGallery
===========

This project's target is to apply new technologies and with this even greater possibilities for the popular www.hung-art.hu and www.wga.hu sites, and it has full consent of the authors of these sites (Dr. Emil Krén and Dániel Marx).

The engine is bilingual (English and Hungarian as the original sites), but there's room for more :)
