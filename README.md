openGallery
===========

This project's target is to apply new technologies and with this even greater possibilities for the popular www.hung-art.hu and www.wga.hu sites, and it has full consent of the authors of these sites (Dr. Emil Krén and Dániel Marx).

The project has been re-created to use my homebrew CMS, which is based on Twitter Bootstrap and Smarty.

 My hope is to create a new site which can continuously expand its database.

The database is in UTF-8 and so are the php files... also UTF-8 is forced across the system.
