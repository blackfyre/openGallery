===========

This project's target is to apply new technologies and with this even greater possibilities for the popular www.hung-art.hu and www.wga.hu sites, and it has full consent of the authors of these sites (Dr. Emil Krén and Dániel Marx).

The engine is bilingual (English and Hungarian as the original sites), but there's room for more...

The development environment is based on WAMP 2.2 with apache 2.2.22, php 5.3.13 and mySQL 5.5.24

The database is in UTF-8 and so are the php files... also UTF-8 is forced across the system.
